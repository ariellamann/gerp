 * This file is the driver function for the gerp program. 
   The gerp program searches through a given directory for 
   word given by the user and prints out all instances of that
   word in the directory to a given output file. 
   This program is helping for searching a large directory for 
   a specific word because also tells the user the exact file 
   and line where they can find that word.
